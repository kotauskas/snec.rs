Configuration system with compile-time field lookup and modification notifications.

## Overview
Snec is a configuration system focused on compile-time guarantees and a way of notifying a running system that a configurable value changed. Most of its power is implemented via macros, which is why those are exported by default.

While no built-in serialization support is provided, the architecture by itself is serialization-agnostic — using Serde and Snec for the same config table structure will work just fine.

Snec's architecture consists of those key components:
- **Config table** — the structure which contains the configuration data for the program. Config tables implement the `Get` trait to access its fields, which allows them to hand out `Handle`s to its fields. Handles ensure that the assigned receiver gets notified when the field changes, unless it's explicitly prompted to perform a silent modification.
- **Entry** — an uninhabited type (type with no possible values) implementing the `Entry` trait, representing an identifier for a field inside of a config table.
- **Receiver** — type implementing the `Receiver` trait which will receive notifications whenever a entry in a config table it's interested in is modified.

## Basic example
```rust
use snec::{ConfigTable, Entry, GetExt as _};
use std::time::{SystemTime, Duration};
#[derive(ConfigTable)]
struct MyConfigTable {
    #[snec]
    when: SystemTime,
    #[snec]
    who: String,
    #[snec]
    in_which_country: String,
}

let mut config_table = MyConfigTable {
    when: SystemTime::UNIX_EPOCH + Duration::from_secs(566_200_800),
    who: "Jeremy".to_string(),
    in_which_country: "USA".to_string(),
};
// To access the fields of our config table, we need to use the get_handle method from
// the GetExt trait (which is a nicer way to use the Get trait). The `entries` part is
// a module generated by the `#[derive(ConfigTable)]`. In most cases, it's desirable
// to reexport the contents of the module in a public module with a different name and
// some documentation, or simply in the containing module if you want the entry
// identifiers to be in the same module as the config table.
let mut handle = config_table.get_handle::<entries::InWhichCountry>();
// After we got the handle, we can use it to get a
// mutable reference to the field and modify it:
{
    let mut in_which_country = handle.modify();
    *in_which_country = "Britain".to_string();
}
// The reason why we put that in a scope and why we had to do this entire two-step process
// is because otherwise we'd implicitly avoid notifying any receivers, which is something
// that we'll look into in the next example. Since we don't have any, it won't really
// hurt if we did this as well:
{
    let in_which_country = handle.modify_silently();
    *in_which_country = "Australia".to_string();
}
```
Using receivers:
```rust
use snec::{ConfigTable, Receiver, Entry, GetExt as _};
use std::time::{SystemTime, Duration};
#[derive(ConfigTable)]
#[snec(receiver = "MyReceiver::new -> MyReceiver")]
struct MyConfigTable {
    #[snec]
    which_year: i64,
    #[snec(entry("snec::EmptyReceiver::new -> snec::EmptyReceiver"))]
    why: String,
    #[snec]
    random_integer_that_i_like: u128,
}

struct MyReceiver;
impl MyReceiver {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // Since the #[derive(ConfigTable)] can only call functions (no arguments, return
        // value implements Receiver) to get a receiver, we have to do this. In a future
        // version, in-place closures might become supported.
        MyReceiver
    }
}
impl Receiver<entries::RandomIntegerThatILike> for MyReceiver {
    fn receive(&mut self, new_value: &u128) {
        println!("My integer has been changed to {}!!", new_value)
    }
}
impl Receiver<entries::WhichYear> for MyReceiver {
    fn receive(&mut self, new_value: &i64) {
        println!("Resceduled to {}", new_value)
    }
}

let mut config_table = MyConfigTable {
    which_year: 1987,
    why: "Accident".to_string(),
    random_integer_that_i_like: 687_800,
};
// Now we have receivers which will immediately react to any changes in the values:
let mut handle = config_table.get_handle::<entries::WhichYear>();
{
    let mut which_year = handle.modify();
    *which_year = 1983;
}
// When the scope ends, the `which_year` guard is dropped and the receiver is informed.
```
